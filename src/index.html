					<p>The old posters and signs in the traditional Montserrat neighborhood of Buenos Aires inspired Julieta Ulanovsky to design this typeface and rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the first half of the twentieth century. As urban development changes that place, it will never return to its original form and loses forever the designs that are so special and unique. The letters that inspired this project have work, dedication, care, color, contrast, light and life, day and night! These are the types that make the city look so beautiful. The Montserrat Project began with the idea to rescue what is in Montserrat and set it free under a libre license, the SIL Open Font License.

					<p>Julieta is a graphic designer and owner of ZkySky, a design studio which she co-founded in 1989 after earning a degree in Typeface Design. She lives and works in Montserrat, the first and oldest neighborhood in Buenos Aires. Julieta admires many type designers including Harald Geisler, and fellow Argentines Juan Pablo del Peral and Alejandro Paul. She is currently developing new variants of Montserrat—italics, plus new weights and styles—and dreams that it will soon become a large, extended family.

					<p>This is the normal family, and it has two sister families so far, Alternates and Subrayada. Many of the letterforms are special in the Alternates family, while 'Subrayada' means 'Underlined' in Spanish and celebrates a special style of underline that is integrated into the letterforms found in the Montserrat neighborhood.</p>
